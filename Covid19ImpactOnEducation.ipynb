    "# Covid19 Impact on K-12 Education\n",
    "By Megan Nalani Chun  \n",
    "Last modified November 2020\n",
    "\n",
    "## Motivation and Problem Statement\n",
    "The children of today will be the decision makers of tomorrow and their education will help determine what those decisions will be. The Covid19 pandemic has changed daily normal activity drastically for people around the world and some areas of society have been impacted more than others. The focus of this study will be on K-12 education during Covid19 since the pandemic and lack of national government guidance has forced school districts to implement varying policies such as those in the data section below. I hope to learn the following:\n",
    "- How much school did students miss?\n",
    "- Under what factors is there a significant difference in the amount of school missed? If there was a similar pandemic, would early implementation of certain policies allow students to have a better continued education? \n",
    "- Do school districts with more income have more access to the internet? And are these districts more likely to have an online policy?\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data \n",
    "This analysis will be scoped to students enrolled in public and private schools across the United States. The following two datasets will be used because of their completeness, trustworthiness, and accessibility in addition to their contents. The first dataset is the Covid19 K-12 Education Data by MCH Strategic Data and the second is demographic data from the Institute of Education Sciences. Licensing and data source information can be found in the [readme](https://github.com/NalaniKai/data-512-final/blob/main/README.md).\n",

    "Combining these datasets by school district will enable the above research questions to be explored.\n",
